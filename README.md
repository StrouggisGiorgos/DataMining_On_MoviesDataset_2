# Steps
* Step 1: Loads data and uses User Average and Item Average strategies to predict movie ratings.
* Step 2: Uses Singular Value Decomposition to predict movie ratings.
* Step 4: Uses User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UCF) to predict movie ratings.
* Step 5: Maps all outputs.
* Bonus 1: Uses a variation of UCF that removes the mean.
* Bonus 2: Uses a variation of UCF that is based on Items, not Users.
